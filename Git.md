## 11 Â· Git Repository & Branch Management

### 11.1 Repository Setup

The project code is hosted on GitHub. To get started, clone the repository using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Guipini/movies-app.git
cd movies-app
npm install
```

### 11.2 Branch Strategy

| Branch Type | Naming Convention | Purpose |
| ----------- | ----------------- | ------- |
| **main**    | `main`            | Production-ready code |
| **develop** | `develop`         | Integration branch for features |
| **feature** | `feature/name`    | New features development |
| **bugfix**  | `bugfix/name`     | Bug fixes |

### 11.3 Developer Workflow

1. **Clone the repository** (first time only)
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Guipini/movies-app.git
   cd movies-app
   ```

2. **Create a new feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Make changes and commit**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Descriptive message about your changes"
   ```

4. **Push your branch to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git push -u origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

5. **Create a Pull Request**
   - Go to the [repository on GitHub](https://github.com/Guipini/movies-app)
   - Click "Compare & pull request"
   - Set the base branch to `develop`
   - Add a description of your changes
   - Request review from team members

### 11.4 Code Review Process

- All code changes require at least one review
- Reviewers should check for:
  - Functionality (meets requirements)
  - Code quality and style
  - Test coverage
  - Documentation

### 11.5 Merging Guidelines

- Feature branches merge into `develop`
- `develop` merges into `main` for releases
- Use squash merging to keep history clean
- Delete branches after merging

### 11.6 Conflict Resolution

If you encounter merge conflicts:

```bash
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout your-branch
git merge develop
# Resolve conflicts in your editor
git add .
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts"
git push origin your-branch
```
